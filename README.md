# HEALTH MONITORING DASHBOARD

Welcome to the Health Monitoring Dashboard front-end repository. The dashboard is designed to provide an overview of key health metrics for individuals such as sleep quality, exercise and nutrition, hydration and so on.
The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a clean layout and easy-to-understand visualizations. Users can easily navigate through different health metrics and view trends over time.

Under the hood, the dashboard is built using React and is designed to be responsive so it can be used on from desktops to mobile phones.

## How to install it ?

Copy and paste in your terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:O-clock-Lara/projet-07-health-monitor-dashboard-front.git
npm install
```

## How to start the development environment ?

`npm start`

Autoreload is enabled if you make any changes and errors are linted in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
